                                 \item I've worked in the R\&D department as an intern to perform my Master's thesis project. The project aims to perform a feasibility study on the field of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) imaging using indirect Time of Flight and Deep Learning. Other than that I've also generated a novel dataset for (NLoS) imaging using Mitsuba 2 and Blender
